<h1><a name="Intro"></a>BDSup2Sub</h1>
<h2><strong>A tool to convert and tweak bitmap based
subtitle streams</strong></h2>
<h3>Version 4.0.1 &nbsp;released 06.01.2012</h3>
BDSup2Sub is a tool I wrote initially to convert captions
demuxed from a Blu-Ray transport stream (M2TS) into the DVD VobSub
format (SUB/IDX) used by many DVD authoring tools - hence the
name.&nbsp;Many more features were added over time as was support
for
other
formats. So in the meantime the name seems a little inappropriate. In a
nutshell, it's a subtitle conversion tool for image based stream
formats
with scaling capabilities and some other nice features.<br>

<h3>What it can't do</h3>
BDSup2Sub only supports image based subtitle
streams. It doesn't (and probably won't ever) support &nbsp;text
based
formats as SRT or SSA. Note that to convert image based subtitles to
text based subtitles would need an OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
approach which is beyond the idea of converting between image based
formats. There are other tools like SubRip and SupRip to convert image
based subtitles to SRT. For the other way round (SRT to BD-SUP), you
may have a look <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=146488">here</a>.<br>
While importing
HD-DVD SUPs is supported, BDSup2Sub can't export this format currently
- and with the commercial death of HD-DVD I think adding this feature
would be a waste of time.&nbsp;

Please
post comments and bug reports to the above thread.
Feedback is welcome - especially from the authors of SubRip, SupRip,
SubtitleCreator or TsMuxer to discuss compatibility issues. To report
problems with a subtitle stream, please either post the stream (if it is
compliant with the forum rules) or upload it to a "one click hoster"
and send me a PM with the link. And don't forget a detailed error
description.<br>
<h3>Credits</h3>
I
dug through hundreds of postings, mainly on Doom9 (started by
Pelican9), several source codes (especially FFmpeg) and all the
documents I could find. Sam Hocevar's DVD subtitle documentation is
especially worth noting. Also the information on exar.ch (while far
from being complete) helped me a lot to understand the HD-DVD SUP
format. Still, I rifled
through hexdumps for hours and hours and hours to find out the details.
Really, you can't imagine.<br>
BDSup2Sub uses a palette quantizer (octree) routine by Jerry
Huxtable which was slightly adapted to the needs of BDSup2Sub (e.g.
extended to include alpha as 4th component).<br>
BDSup2Sub uses the PNG Encoder by J. David Eisenberg to have
better
control over the written palettes of exported PNG images (in BDN XML
mode). I just added the missing code to
write the tRNS segment for transparency.<br>
The scaling algorithm is partly based on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-image-scaling/">Java
image scaling library</a> &nbsp;by Morten Nobel-Joergensen
which again is based on the "Java Image Util".<br>
See <a href="#Source_Code">Source Code</a> and <a href="#Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> for

<h3>Known issues</h3>
Reading/writing
data from/to transport streams is quite a hassle since the formats are
usually not well documented&nbsp; and you will always stumble
over a stream that either contains authoring errors or uses features so
uncommon that they are not documented anywhere. Indeed, most of the
time it's impossible to tell if some weird stream is only on the edge
of what is allowed or simply faulty. So often enough, programs that
read or write transport streams
will only support a certain amount of commonly used (and known)
sub-features. <br>
Therefore
it's likely that BDSup2Sub will stumble over the streams
created by other programs or other programs will have problems reading
the streams created by BDSup2Sub. It's generally hard to tell
who's fault it is, but here's a
list of issues that I'm aware of:<br>
<ul>
<li>BDSup2Sub exports only plain subtitles (one image with
start
and end time). If an imported SUP contains anything beyond this (e.g.
palette animations, cropping animations, image animations) etc.
BDSup2Sub will remove them and output a warning. This
might lead to unexpected results. E.g. if a BD-SUP contains animated
palettes, only the final state of the palette will be displayed and
exported. While BDSup2Sub tries to detect alpha
changes for fading in and out and use the most opaque color for
display, this detection may fail under certain circumstances or the
displayed palette may even be a mixture of different animation/fading
stages. Also, if a BD-SUP contains more than one image ("composition
object") per frame, only the first image will
be displayed and exported.</li>
<li>Alpha/palette
updates are only partly supported for SUB/IDX and SUP/IFO. For the
experts among
you: only the first LN_CTLI and the first PX_CTLI is considered per
update. Also the line/column values are completely ignored and the
palette/alpha update is assumed to be valid for the whole bitmap.</li>
<li>Although
BDSup2Sup can export SUB/IDX (or SUP/IFO) in higher resolutions (720p
or 1080p),
keep in mind that this is not a standard format. While some programs
might accept these high resolution files, others might crash or
show erratic results (e.g. this seems to be the case for SubRip).
Use this
feature at your own risk. For full compatibility, especially if the
conversion target is a DVD, use PAL or NTSC only. Also read the <a href="#Notes_on_SUPIFO">notes
about SUP/IFO</a>.</li>
<li>HD-DVD
SUPs don't seem to contain any information about the screen resolution.
Therefore BDSup2Sub assumes a resolution of 1920x1080. If there are
HD-DVDs with lower resolutions (e.g. 720p), this will be a problem. I'd
have to add some kind of resolution selection then.</li>
</ul>
I
tried to catch the most common problems (e.g. out of bounds access due
to corrupt size information or wrong RLE info), yet it's kinda
impossible to catch every possible fault in every possible stream. So
don't be surprised if BDSUP2SUB shuts down with or without an
error message. I recommend to start it via the command line in this
case to see
every exception thrown. E.g. a problem of the Java Runtime can't be
caught &nbsp;by &nbsp;the application and is therefore only
printed to
the console.<br><br>

<h3>Editing text fields</h3>BDSup2Sub supports input checking while typing in
all text input fields (including editable combo boxes):<br>
<ul>
<li>If the background of a text field is white,&nbsp;the
current value is ok and/or has already been applied.</li>
<li>If
the background becomes yellow,&nbsp;the currently entered value is
valid, but a modified value will be used. E.g. a valid time value will
be changed due to frame rate synchronization. To see the value that
will be actually used, simply press return. </li>
<li>If
the background becomes red, the current value is invalid and will be
replaced by a fitting value (if possible) or the the previous value of
the input field. To see the value that will be actually used, simply
press return.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Keyboard shortcuts (Hotkeys/Mnemonics)</h3>There are keyboard shortcuts for most menu items,
buttons and checkboxes. Note that the support for these hotkeys depends
on your Operating System and its user interface settings. E.g. on
Windows, the hotkeys are displayed only if you press the "Alt" key by
default. There's a global setting to hide the hotkeys under "Display
Properties/Appearance/Effects" which defined whether the hotkeys are
displayed or hidden by default in all applications. Some programs as
Firefox seem to ignore this setting, the Java Runtime Environment (and
thus BDSup2Sub) doesn't.<br>
Exception for the rule: until I come up
with a more convenient solution, Alt+Left Cursor and Alt+Right cursor
move to previous or next subtitle in the edit and move dialogs (without
saving). On Linux and Mac OS, the accelerator key may differ or the
hotkeys may not work at all. Sorry, I can't test this.
<h3><a name="Zooming_in_and_out_"></a>Zooming
in and out<br>
</h3>
In
case you didn't notice: by clicking left/right in the source and
target&nbsp;panels, you can zoom in and out to view details of the
current sub
picture. This is especially useful for finding the correct
alpha/luminance thresholds in SUB/IDX (or SUP/IFO) mode.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Color_Palettes"></a>Color Palettes</h2>

The
subtitle data on a Blu-Ray consists of run length encoded images up
to 1920x1080 pixels with a color/alpha palette of up to 256 entries
(where each undefined entry and the 256th entry are completely
transparent by definition).
Each single subpicture
frame can have a separate palette. The subpicture data on HD-DVD is
similar, the main difference is that the palette for each frame has
always 256 entries.<br>
The subpicture data on a DVD
consists of run length encoded images up to 720x576 (PAL) or 720x480
(NTSC) pixels, where each image can use up to 4 colors from a common
palette consisting of 16 colors. This global palette is defined in the
IFO
files of a DVD. For SUP/IFO streams, this info is read from an IFO file
was well; for subtitles in SUB/IDX format, the information is
stored in the IDX file. <br>
All
bitmap based subtitle formats are able to define transparency in a way.
For DVD based subtitles, each of the colors per frame can have a
transparency between 0..15. The HD formats can define an alpha value
between 0..255 for each palette entry. Transparency is usually used for
a transparent background, but it can be also used for fading. BDSup2Sub
tries to detect fading and remove it to be able to display and convert
each subtitle. <br>
<h3><a name="Palette_Modes"></a>Palette Modes</h3>
So to convert from SUP (BD/HD-DVD) to SUB/IDX (or SUP/IFO), not
only the pictures and display offsets have to be scaled, but also the
color/alpha information has to be reduced. This is the reason why only
"create new" palette mode is available when converting a 256 color
format like BD-SUP to a DVD
format like SUB/IDX.<br>
<br>
In "create palette" mode for SUB/IDX (or SUP/IFO) output, BDSup2Sub
uses the following approach for each
subpicture frame:<br>
<ol>
<li>the dominant color in the original picture is identified
((non-)transparency and luminance are used as weight factors)</li>
<li>the
dominant color is matched with the default primary colors in the global
palette (white, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta)<br>
The
closest match is chosen as main color. A darker tone of the same color
is chosen as 2nd color. The two other colors are always black and a
transparent color.</li>
<li>the subpicture is downsized to either PAL or NTSC,
depending on the setting of "Output Format"<br>
Scaling up/down &nbsp;is done with a selectable scaling filter.
However,
only transparency (alpha) and luminance are considered: if the mean
value of the alpha channel is below "Alpha Threshold" , &nbsp;the
target pixel is considered to be transparent (palette entry 0). Else it
is set to either the primary color (palette entry 1), the darker
primary color (palette entry) or black (palette entry 3) depending on
whether the pixels's luminance is above/below "Hi/Med Threshold" or
"Med/Low Threshold".<br>
Note that the luminance thresholds are
automatically detected (when loading a SUP), while the alpha threshold
is set to a default value.</li>
</ol>
<br>
In
SUP or BDN XML export mode, three different palette creation modes can
be selected
when scaling SUPs: "keep existing" doesn't change the palette, but uses
the nearest existing color for each scaled pixel. This leads usually to
good results, but if the palette lacks alpha/brightness/color
gradations, the result may be suboptimal. The mode "create new" creates
a new palette for each caption and "dithered" creates a new palette and
applies a Floyd-Steinberg dithering matrix. This last approach is the
slowest, but usually there is no visual difference to "create new". The
default setting is "create new".<br>
<br>
In
VobSub or SUP/IFO export mode, the palette creation can be only changed
if the
imported caption stream was a VobSub&nbsp;or SUP/IFO as well. Then
you may choose to
keep the existing (i.e. imported) palette. In any other case, the
palette has to be
created anyway so the option is grayed out.<br>
<h3><a name="Interpreting_the_SUP_palette"></a>Interpreting
the SUP palette</h3>
BDSup2Sub
assumes that the palette entries in SUP streams (BD as well as HD-DVD)
are stored as Y, Cr, Cb (three bytes in this order). I can't validate
this for HD-DVDs, but for BDs, the resulting colors displayed in
BDSup2Sub match exactly what my PS3 displays. I'm aware though that
some other programs like SupRip and MPC-HC caption renderers seems to
assume a different color order than BDSup2Sub or the PS3 (Y, Cb, Cr
instead of Y, Cr, Cb). This&nbsp;means of course that they will
display
colors differently
(e.g. Cyan becomes Yellow and vice versa). <br>While I'm pretty sure that BDSup2Sub uses the correct order, just
for the case that the byte order Y, Cb, Cr is needed instead, there's
an an menu item "Settings-&gt;Swap Cr/Cb" to swap the Cr and Cb
components when reading a SUP. When exporting a SUP with the swap
option enabled, this also means that the Cr/Cb components are swapped
then compared to those in the imported SUP. So while BDSup2Sub shows
the colors like e.g. SupRip for the imported SUP then, SupRip won't
show the same colors for the <span style="font-style: italic;">exported</span>
SUP. Note that with the swap option disabled, the exported SUP has
exactly the same palette as the imported SUP. <br>
When exporting SUB/IDX though, the&nbsp;colors displayed by
BDSup2Sub <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span>
matter, as the color matching is done in RGB space. Also the palette
colors written to the IDX file are stored as RGB values. As long as
other tools respect this definition, the colors should appear as they
are displayed by BDSup2Sub.<br>
<h3><a name="Editing_the_default_DVD_palette_for"></a>Editing the "default" DVD palette (for "create new" palette
mode)</h3>
To
allow a at least a minimum of anti-aliasing during scaling down/up with
SUB/IDX (or SUP/IFO) as output format, the 16 color palette used by BDSup2Sup in "create
palette" mode has one light and one
dark tone for each predefined color. &nbsp;E.g. there is a dark
blue and a light
blue. White is a special case, since it's the most common subtitle
color: in addition to white, there is also a light and a dark gray. So
for lighter subtitles, the conversion can select white and dark gray,
while it can select light gray and dark gray for darker subtitles.<br>
If
you're unhappy with the default palette, you can edit the default
palette used for conversion to SUB/IDX via the according menu item
"Edit default DVD palette" in
the "Preferences" menu. Just keep in mind that if you edit a light
color, you should also change the dark color accordingly (and vice
versa). Also "white, "light gray" and "dark gray" must be different
tones of the same color or else you'll get erratic results.<br>
Also
note that when you use VobSub or SUP/IFO as import and export format,
you may as
well choose to keep the existing palette. Then BDSup2Sub's
default&nbsp;
palette is completely ignored. Note that when you're scaling, this
might lead to worse results than the "create new" palette mode if no
intermediate color is present (in the frame palette) for antialiasing.<br>
<h3><a name="Editing_the_imported_DVD_palette"></a>Editing the "imported" DVD palette</h3>
When
the import format is either VobSub or SUP/IFO, the menu item ""Edit
imported DVD palette" is enabled,
which let's you edit the 16 color palette imported from the IDX or IFO.
You can change any of the 16 colors as you wish. Just keep in mind that
each caption is still limited to a 4 color frame palette which can be
edited via a separate menu item ("Edit DVD Frame Palette" described in
the next chapter).<br>
Note
that editing the imported palette and editing the frame palette/alpha
values are the only edit features in BDSup2Sub that actually change the
source image. Though this might seem a little inconsistent (in that all
other edit features only influence the target subtitle), I decided that
these features make more sense this way since else they would only work
when converting from SUB/IDX to SUP/IFO or vice versa and using the
"keep palette" mode.<br>
<h3><a name="Editing_the_Frame_Palette_and_Alpha"></a>Editing the Frame Palette and Alpha values (DVD input only)</h3>
As
already mentioned,&nbsp;DVD subtitle formats (SUB/IDX or SUP/IFO)
use a
4 color palette and 4 alpha values for each frame. All the values can
vary from 0 to 15, where the number means the palette entry from the
global 16 color palette for the palette while it defines the absolute
transparency for the alpha values: 0 is completely transparent, 15 is
completely opaque. As editing the imported DVD palette, editing the
frame palette/alpha is only available when the import format is either
VobSub to SUP/IFO and it also influences the source image displayed in
the upper half of the main screen. <br>
Note that apart from changing
the palette/alpha values for the current caption, you can also apply
the same setting to all subtitles ("Set All"). This is true for
restoring the default values (as defined in the original stream): you
can either restore only the values for the current caption ("Reset") or
for the whole stream ("Reset All").<br>
<h3><a name="Automatic_fixing_of_invisible_subtitles"></a>Automatic fixing of invisible subtitles due to zero alpha
frame palette&nbsp;(DVD input only)</h3>
In
some DVD subtitle streams (SUB/IDX and SUP/IFO) single subtitles are
invisible since all four alpha values are zero (due to an authoring
fault). In some cases, this hides a useful subtitle, in some cases it
hides a garbage bitmap. Anyway, apart from manually setting the
according alpha values via the "Edit DVD Frame Palette" menu item,
BDSup2Sub can also try to fix this problem automatically by keeping the
last non-zero frame palette (i.e. the one from the previous subtitle).
This feature can be switched on/off either via the command line
(/fixinv) or with the menu item "Fix invisible frames" from the
settings menu.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span>Note that changing this setting in the menu has no
influence on the currently loaded subtitle since the alpha fixing
already took place then. You need to reload the current subtitle file
to see an effect.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Concepts_and_Features"></a>Other concepts and features</h2><h3><a name="Output_Format"></a>Output Format</h3>While
the output format is indeed a conversion option, currently it's not
located in the conversion dialog but in the control panel of the main
window. The main reason for this is to keep those options in the
control panel which directly affect the bitmap in the target panel.<br>There are four output modes available:<br><ul><li>SUB/IDX: also known as VobSub, a DVD subtitle format</li><li>SUP/IFO: a DVD subtitle format defined by the author of IFOEdit</li><li>SUP(BD): &nbsp;a Blu-Ray PGS stream demultiplexed from a M2TS by tools like EAC3TO or tsMuxeR.</li><li>XML/PNG: the Sony BDN subtitle format consisting of an XML file containing the times etc. and palettized bitmaps in PNG format.</li></ul>Depending
on the selected output format, the bitmap displayed in the target panel
will be updated (4 color palette in DVD modes vs. 256 color palette in
BD modes).<br><h3><a name="Output_resolution"></a>Output Resolution</h3>BDSup2Sub supports only default output resolutions:<br><ul><li>NTSC: 720x480<br>Command line options ntsc, 480</li><li>PAL: 720x576<br>Command line&nbsp;options: pal, 576</li><li>HD 720: 1280x720<br>Command line&nbsp;options: 720p and 720</li><li>HD 1440: 1440x1080<br>Command line option:&nbsp;1440x1080</li><li>FULL HD: 1920x1080<br>Command line&nbsp;options: 1080p and 1080</li></ul>
<h3><a name="Forced_subtitles"></a>Forced
subtitles</h3>
In BD-SUP, VobSub and SUP/IFO streams,
individual subtitles can be marked as "forced" which tells the player
to display them even if subtitles are switched off. This
means that forced subtitles and normal subtitles can be stored in the
same
stream. If forced subtitle frames are detected in an imported stream
(and <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
then), you can choose to export only the forced subtitles to SUB/IDX or
SUP by checking the according checkbox in the export dialog (or by
using the "/forced" parameter on the command line).<br><h3><a name="Source_and_target_frame_rate"></a>Source
and target frame rate</h3>
When
reading a BD-SUP, BDSup2Sub tries to read the source frame rate from
the stream. Keep in mind that it might be wrong or inaccurate! For
HD-DVD SUPs, there is no frame rate information, so always 24p is
assumed. However the source frame rate is only important if you change
the frame rate during export. In this case, it's used together with the
target frame rate to calculate the factor used to manipulate the time
stamps. Note that to convert a movie from NTSC (3:2 pulldown) to PAL,
you would still need to select 24p as source and not NTSC or 30p
because the source timing is natively 24p and this is the only thing
that matters for the conversion.<br>
The target frame rate is always important, as
it's always used to synchronize the start/end times with the frame
rate. For best results, always select the correct target frame rate.
Note that the default setting only depends on the resolution (PAL
-&gt; 25p, NTSC -&gt; 30p, HD -&gt; 24p).<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<h3><a name="Filter_Modes"></a>Filter Modes</h3>
You
can select a scaling filter in the according combo box in the main
view. The fastest algorithm is Bilinear, the slowest modes are Lanczos3
and Mitchell. For SUP/XML export with a 256 color palette, Mitchell or Lanczos3 are
usually the best choice. For VobSub (or SUP/IFO) with only 4 colors, this
is harder
to predict. Just play around with the filters, alpha threshold and
luminance thresholds to find the best quality.<br>
<h3><a name="Free_Scaling"></a>Free Scaling</h3>BDSup2Sub allows to scale captions in X and Y direction
independently of the screen resolution. This feature can be used to
e.g. enlarge the captions to make them more readable or to shrink them
a little bit to make them fit into the cinemascope bars. Simply enter
any value between 0.5 and 2.0 for scaling in X and Y direction. Indeed,
for conversion from BD to DVD it's often a good idea to scale the
subtitles by a factor of e.g. 1.2 to make them more readable. To
compensate for the slightly increased size, you may want to move the
captions with the "move all" feature then.<br><h3><a name="Fixing_of_too_short_frames"></a>Fixing of too short frames</h3>Some
streams contains single subtitles which are too short to read. It's
possible to let BDSup2Sub automatically fix these subtitles. There's <a href="#Command_Line_Interface">command line option</a> ("/tmin") as well as an option in the <a href="#Conversion_Dialog">conversion dialog</a>.
Every time that a caption is shorter than the&nbsp;given time (in
milliseconds), BDSup2Sub will try to increase the display time to the
given time. Note however that this is not possible if the next subtitle
starts before that. In this case, the end time of the subtitle in
question will be set to the start time of the following frame.<br><h3><a name="Merging_frames"></a>Merging frames</h3>For
some reason (probably due to a buggy authoring tool), there are quite a
few BD subtitle streams which contain duplicated subtitle frames. I.e.
the very same frame is repeated two, three or even more times with no
or very short gaps between it. BDSup2Sub automatically tries to fix
this issue, yet sometimes this behavior might not be wanted. Therefore
it's possible to configure this feature via the command line option
"/tmerge:&lt;t&gt;". The default value is 200ms, which means that two
identical subtitles with a gap smaller or equal to 200ms will be merged
to one subtitle. Setting the time to 0ms ("/tmerge:0") effectively
disables the feature.<br><h3><a name="Language_info"></a>Language info</h3>Some
subtitle streams contain information about the language of the stream.
E.g. SUB/IDX, SUP/IFO and XML do, SUP BD and SUP HD don't. For those
formats that don't support language information, BDSup2Sub tries to
guess the correct language from the file name. If a file name for a
BD-SUP or SUP-HD input stream contains a valid English&nbsp;language
name (e.g. "german" or "french"), this will be used as default. Note
that this can fail if the file name contains language names for other
reason (e.g. movie titles like "Greek Wedding" or "Johnny English").
Therefore, there's always the possibility to edit the language in the <a href="#Export_Dialog">export dialog</a>.
Then again, the language info is only needed if the export format
supports it. If you export to BD-SUP, there's no need to define it and
the option in the export dialog is grayed out.<br>
<h2><a name="Export_Dialog"></a>Export Dialog</h2>
When a stream is saved, the export dialog pops up. It contains the
following items:<br>
<ul>
<li>Filename<br>
The file name used for export. You can open a file browser by clicking
the "Browse" button or edit the text manually.<br>
Note that the correct extension is always appended/replaced
automatically.</li>
<li>Language:<br>
This option is only available if the exported format supports
it.&nbsp;<br>
If
the <a href="#Language_info">language setting</a> of the input stream is known (or was guessed from
its file name),the according language is already selected.</li>
<li>Export only forced<br>
If this checkbox is checked, only subtitles with a&nbsp;<a href="#Forced_subtitles">forced flag</a> will be
exported</li>
<li>Export palette in PGCEdit text format<br>
This option is only available for DVD output formats (SUB/IDX or
SUP/IFO).<br>
If
selected, a file with the same name as the output stream, but with the
extension "txt" will be created that contains the palette in a format
that can be imported into <a href="http://download.videohelp.com/r0lz/pgcedit/">PGCEdit</a>.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Conversion_Dialog"></a>Conversion
Dialog</h2>
The conversion dialog pops up after a subtitle stream was loaded. You
can also open it via the "Settings" menu.<br>
It shows the following items:<br>
<ul>
<li>Resolution<br>
If
you check the checkbox, the <a href="#Output_resolution">resolution</a> of the output stream is changed
to the&nbsp;resolution selected in the listbox "Resolution" below.</li>
<li>Move<br>
If you check the checkbox "Apply 'move all' settings', a previously
selected <a href="#Moving">move setting</a> will be
applied after the import.<br>
Note that this option is only available if &nbsp;a move setting
exists and a new stream is loaded.</li>
<li>Frame Rate<br>
If the checkbox "Change frame rate" is checked, a <a href="#Source_and_target_frame_rate">frame rate conversion</a>
is done. Else only the target frame rate is used to synchronize the
frame times.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Global forced flags<br>
The listbox "Force All" let's you choose whether to keep the imported <a href="#Forced_subtitles">forced flags</a> or to
set/clear the flags of all subtitles in the output stream.</li>
<li>Apply free scaling<br>
In
addition to the normal scaling due to resolution conversion, which
retains the ratio between subtitle and screen size, this option allows
to <a href="#Free_Scaling">scale the subtitles independently</a>.<br>
A factor of 1.0 means 100%, so to increase the subtitles to 120% in
width and height, use 1.2 for "Scale X" and "Scale Y"</li>
<li>Times</li>
<ul>
<li>Delay<br>
A signed delay value in milliseconds that is added to each subtitle
start/end time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Fixing_of_too_short_frames">Fix too short frames</a><br>
If
this option is checked, each subtitle that is shown for less than "Min
Time" milliseconds will be patched to be shown for at least this value.</li>
</ul>
<li>Defaults</li>
<ul>
<li>Store: stores the current settings in the <a href="#The_INI_file_persistence">ini file</a>. They
will be used as default values the next time the dialog is shown.</li>
<li>Restore: restores the last stored settings from the <a href="#The_INI_file_persistence">ini file</a>.</li>
<li>Reset: resets setting to the "factory defaults" that are
also used if the ini file doesn't exist yet.</li><br>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Edit_Dialog"></a>Edit Dialog</h2>
<h3>Editing time stamps and position</h3>
This dialog let's you edit the subtitle data of a single frame. Like position, times and forced flag. <br>You can access this dialog via the Edit menu or by left clicking in the preview panel
(lower right) of the main window.<br>&nbsp;<br><table style="text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 461px; height: 241px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr align="center"><td style="width: 441px;" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control Panel</td></tr><tr align="center"><td style="width: 441px; height: 123px;" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Preview Panel</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 422px; height: 0px;">Times Panel</td><td style="width: 441px; height: 0px;">Position Panel</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 422px;">Flags Panel</td><td style="width: 441px;">Patches Panel</td></tr><tr align="center"><td style="width: 441px;" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Buttons Panel</td></tr></tbody></table><br><ul><li>Control Panel<br>The
number of current subtitle is displayed on the left. With the buttons
on the right you can navigate to the previous/next frame.<br>The black buttons (right) just skip to the next frame without saving, the red buttons (left) store the last edits first.<br>Note that Alt+Cursor left/right is the keyboard shortcut for the (black) previous/next buttons.</li><li>Preview Panel<br>Shows the current subtitle position inside the screen. Via the sliders you can move the subtitle position directly</li><li>Times Panel<br>
The start/end display time can be
edited in the text fields "Start Time" and "End Time". The times are
automatically synchronized to the target frame rate. Also illegal
values (overlapping with previous end time or next start time) are
automatically corrected.Note however that the minimum display time
defined in the conversion dialog is not checked or forced when editing
manually. Instead of editing the end time, you can also set the
duration directly by editing the "Duration" text field (given in
milliseconds). Again, the duration is synchronized to the frame rate
and automatically fixed to not overlap with the beginning of the next
subtitle.<br>
Additionally, you can set the duration with the buttons
"Min" and "Max". "Min" will set the duration to the minimum value
defined in the conversion dialog, "Max" will set it one frame before
the beginning of the next subtitle. If there is no next subtitle,
(because the current&nbsp;is the last one), a duration of 10
seconds
will be applied.</li><li>Position Panel<br>Instead of using the sliders in the preview panel, you can also enter the subtitle position  via the edit
fields " X Offset" and "Y Offset".Illegal values are automatically corrected.<br>Furthermore
there are some buttons for default positions. "Center" centers the
subtitle horizontally, "Top" and "Bottom" move it to the upper/lower
cinemascope bar (if possible).&nbsp;</li><li>Flags Panel<br>Checking/unchecking "Forced Caption" will make the current subtitle a forced subtitle.<br>By
checking "Exlude from Export", you can delete a subtitle from the
exported stream. It will be displayed with a large red cross to show
that it will not be exported.</li><li>Patches Panel<br>
Sometimes
you might want to keep only parts of a caption, e.g. because there's
text for the hearing impaired like "[birds chirping]" mixed with normal
subtitles. To avoid the necessity to use OCR or to export to XML BDN to
edit the bitmap manually, BDSup2Sub features a very simple system of
erasing rectangular regions inside a caption.<br>
In the edit dialog,
just draw a rectangle by left clicking where the upper left corner
should be located, dragging the mouse to the lower right corner and
releasing it there. You can see a yellow rectangle while dragging- if
you release the mouse button, this selection rectangle will be
automatically adjusted to be completely within the green box which
shows the borders of the caption's bitmap.<br>
When a valid selection
has been made, the "Erase" button in the edit dialog will become
active. If you press it, the pixels inside the selection will be erased
by filling the region with fully transparent pixels. Note that you can
apply multiple of these erase regions to one caption. Also, as these
erase command are put on a stack internally, you can undo them as long
as you didn't&nbsp; close the program or load another stream. Just
press "Undo Erase" do remove the last erase region or "Undo all" to
remove all of them for this caption.</li><li>Buttons Panel<br>"Ok"
stores the changes and returns, "Cancel" returns without taking over
the changes, "Save Changes" stores the changes but doesn't close the
dialog. "Prev" and "Next" skip to the previous/next subtitle without
(!) saving the changes.<br></li></ul>

<h2><a name="Move_Crop_Dialog"></a>Move/Crop
Dialog</h2>
<h3><a name="Moving_all_captions_insideoutside"></a>Moving all captions inside/outside bounds</h3>
BDSup2Sub 2.7 introduced a feature to move all captions outside/inside
certain bounds. The idea is to either move the captions <span style="font-style: italic;">outside</span> the visible
cinemascope picture (to not cover parts of the picture) or to move them
completely <span style="font-style: italic;">inside</span>
the picture to e.g. use a 21:9 screen without losing the captions. The
implemented algorithm is pretty simple: captions that are completely
inside the upper half of the screen are defined as "upper" captions,
while those completely inside the lower half of the screen are defined
as "lower" captions. Captions that begin in the upper half and end in
the lower half are not moved at all.<br>
When moving captions "outside",
the upper captions are simply moved to the top of the screen plus a
given offset in pixels. The lower captions are moved to bottom of the
screen, where again the pixel offset between the bottom of the caption
and the bottom of the screen is kept.<br>
When moving captions "inside",
it's important to define the correct target picture aspect ratio. E.g.
if you want to move the captions inside a 21:9 picture, you need to
select a aspect ratio 2.33 (or push the button labeled "21:9"). Now the
upper captions are positioned <span style="font-style: italic;">offset</span>
pixels below the upper border of the 21:9 screen and the lower captions
are positioned <span style="font-style: italic;">"Y
offset"</span>
pixels above the lower border of the 21:9 screen.<br>
Indeed,
"inside" and "outside" work pretty much exactly the same apart from the
fact that when moving "inside", the screen height is virtually
decreased by the given factor.<br>
<h3><a name="Moving_all_captions_horizontally"></a>Moving all captions horizontally</h3>
Since BDSup2Sub 3.9.6 &nbsp;it's also possible to move (all)
captions horizontally<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.
You can either move to the left, to the right or center the captions to
the middle of the screen,. When moving to the left or to the right,
BDSup2Sub will try to keep a minimum distance of "<span style="font-style: italic;">X offset</span>"
to the left or right screen border. However, when the caption is too
wide, the actual distance to the border might be smaller or even 0.<br>
<h3><a name="Cropping_of_screen_size"></a>Cropping (of screen size)</h3>
Implemented
due to user request. If a crop offset is defined, the exported Y
coordinates will be reduced by the cropping offset. Usually, this
should be used in combination with moving captions inside bounds -
that's why it's located there in the GUI. Anyway, the crop offset is
also the minimum Y coordinate for exported captions. E.g. if the crop
offset is 100, all captions with a higher Y coordinate will be moved up
by 100 pixels and captions with Y &lt;= crop offset will have an Y
coordinate of 0 after the export. The crop offset will be displayed as
red line in all preview windows. It can be reset to 0 (without moving
captions) by using the according menu command (reset crop offset).<br>
Since
3.0.1, the crop offset is assumed to be symmetrical. Hence two red
lines are displayed and also the maximum Y coordinate is reduced to fit
into the cropped screen. Now also the screen size in exported IDX or
SUP files is reduced&nbsp;by 2*Crop Offset Y. E.g. if the target
resolution is 1080p without cropping and you select a crop offset of
100, the resulting screen size is 1920*880.<br>
<h3><a name="Automatic_Cropping_of_caption_images"></a>Automatic Cropping (of caption images)</h3>
In
some subtitle
streams the images that contain the captions are much larger than it
would be necessary. Indeed, in some cases, the image is as large as the
whole screen area (e.g. 720x576 for PAL). While this doesn't really
matter when just displaying the stream, it makes certain features of
BDSup2Sub unusable (e.g. moving captions).&nbsp; Since I saw this
only
happen in VobSubs, SUP/IFO and BDN XMLs, BDSup2Sub applies automatic
cropping
for these input formats. This means that BDSup2Sub crops the first/last
lines/columns of each image that don't contain any opaque pixels
resulting in an image that contains only the subtitle but no empty
border.<br>
Unfortunately,
probably due to wrong RGB/YCBCr conversion in certain tools, the
transparent color is not fully transparent (i.e.
alpha = 0) in some streams, but the alpha value is just very small
(e.g. alpha = 7). To work around this, BDSup2Sub defines an "alpha
cropping threshold": if &nbsp;a
pixel's alpha value is smaller than this threshold, it will be
considered invisible. The default value for this threshold is 14, but
it can be set (only) via the CLI option "/acrop". Note that setting
"/acrop" to 0 disables automatic cropping.<br>
<br>
It's worth to mention that the alpha
cropping threshold is also used to decide whether to patch the colors
of transparent pixels. Again, when displaying a subtitle stream, it
doesn't matter if a fully transparent pixel is yellow or black. For
scaling this matters though, as all 4 components (alpha, r ,g ,b) are
used to determine a new color/alpha value. Now if all transparent
pixels are yellow instead of black, the pixels at the outer border of
each character will&nbsp; get a yellow tint. To avoid this effect,
BDSup2Sub patches all colors with an alpha value smaller than the alpha
cropping &nbsp;threshold to be (transparent) black. Note that if
you
disable automatic cropping by setting the alpha cropping threshold to
0, this also disables palette patching and might lead to a color tint
when scaling.<br>

<br>
Palettized or 24bit ARGB&nbsp;images are supported for import - the
latter will be converted to a 256 color
palette automatically. As a matter of fact, the BDN implementation of
BDSup2Sub is pretty unrestricted regarding the image formats for
import. Apart from PNG, also e.g. BMP, JPG or GIF files should work.
Indeed every format supported by Java's ImageIO library will work. <br>
Note
that BDSup2Sub will only export 8bit palettized PNGs with transparency
(via tRNS tag) for maximum compatibility with Sonic Scenarist HDMV.
Unfortunately, only a few (free) graphic programs support this format
correctly. <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>
however
seems to work just fine. So via BDN SUP export/import, it's even
possible to alter any caption beyond the built-in possibilities of
BDSup2Sub.<br>
<br>
Note: although the BDN XML looks pretty straight forward and
clean,&nbsp;the
timing information in this format is a little weird for unknown
reasons. Indeed the
timings are always based on an integer frame rate. E.g. in the above
example, while the frame rate is 23.976 Hz (24p), the
time codes are related to a 24Hz Signal.<br>
E.g. for the end time this means:<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
<br>
</span></span>

2 hours = 2*60*60 seconds = 7200s <br>
26 minutes = 26*60 seconds = 1560s<br>
38 seconds = 38s<br>
18 frames = 18/24 s = 750ms<br>
In sum this equals 8798750 ms.<br>
Now since the given frame rate is really 23.976Hz, this value is
multiplied by 1.001<br>
This equals 8807548.75ms<br>
This equals 2 hours, 26 minutes, 47 seconds and 549ms<br>

Regarding
the language index: there are some tools that store multiple subtitle
streams inside one SUB/IDX file (e.g. for different language). In this
case, the "id, index" keyword does exist several times, where each
appearance has a different index and a separate section of
timestamps,filepos pairs defining the captions for this index.<br>
Note
that BDSup2Sub ignores all captions but those after the id,index header
that fits the language index defined via the "langidx" keyword.<br>
<h3><a name="Notes_on_SUPIFO"></a>Notes on SUP/IFO</h3>
The
SUP/IFO format as defined by IfoEdit/VobEdit is supported since version
3.9.0 due to public demand. Internally (e.g. regarding RLE encoding,
palette definitions etc.) it's virtually the same as SUB/IDX. Note that
there are some limitations to this format though. <br>
Firstly, the
palette and the screen size are stored inside an IFO file. BDSup2Sub
needs a valid IFO file for each SUP file and both have to share the
same file name (except the extension of course). If you e.g. exported a
file "english.sup" from a "VTS_02_1.VOB" and the according IFO is
"VTS_02_0.IFO", then you need to copy the IFO and rename it to
"english.ifo" to make BDSup2Sub accept it as input.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that
BDSup2Sub recognizes the extension "IFO" for SUP/IFO, but not "SUP"</span>.
The reason is that BDSup2Sub can differ between BD-SUP and HD-DVD-SUP
during import only because both format have different packet
identifiers.
Unfortunately, HD-DVD-SUP and DVD-SUP use the same (outer) package
structure so they can only be distinguished between during parsing of
the&nbsp;command buffer. At this time, BDSup2Sub already decided to
treat a SUP with that package header as "HD-DVD-SUP" and will throw an
error.<br>
When exporting, you should be aware that there are only PAL
and NTSC resolutions defined in the DVD format (and therefore in the
IFO).Thus hires or cropped formats will lead to major problems, even
when importing these files back in BDSup2Sub. I'd strongly suggest to
use VobSub in such cases.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></span>
<h2><a name="Command_Line_Interface"></a>Command
line interface</h2>
While BDSup2Sub has a graphical interface, it can be used from the
command line as well. Note that to start the GUI without an open
console, use "javaw" instead under Windows.<br>
<br>
Syntax1:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; width: 620px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">java -jar BDSup2Sub.jar
[options]</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
</span></div>
<br>
If there is no file name given (all passed parameters are options
starting with "/"), the GUI is started. Still you can pass options to
e.g. preselect the target frame rate or resolution. If there's only one
parameter which is either "/help" or "/?",&nbsp;a short help will
be
displayed&nbsp; in the console instead (i.e. the GUI will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> start). <br>
<br>
Syntax2:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; width: 620px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">java -jar BDSup2Sub.jar
&lt;in&gt; </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">[options]</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
</span></div>
<br>
If there is only file name ("&lt;in&gt;") given, the
GUI is started and the file with the given name is loaded immediately.
Options passed will be used as default settings if possible. <br>
<br>
Syntax3:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; width: 620px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">java -jar BDSup2Sub.jar
&lt;in&gt; &lt;out&gt; [options]</span><br>
</div>
<br>
If
there is an source file name &lt;in&gt; and a target file
name&nbsp;&lt;out&gt;, the GUI is not started, but
BDSup2Sub behaves
like a command line application.Note that it's mandatory that the
target file name has an extension, which might be either ".sup",
".ifo", ".idx" or ".sub". If the extension of the output file name is
".idx" or
".sub", the output format will be SUB/IDX. If the extension of the
output file name is ".sup", the output format will be BD-SUP. If the
extension is ":ifo", the output format is SUP/IFO.<br>

<h3>Using wildcards at the command line</h3>
Since version 2.0,
wildcards are supported at the command line (if both, source and target
file name are given). Due to limitations of the Java runtime, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the complete parameter string has
to be enclosed in double quotes if wildcards are used</span>!!!
To still allow file names with spaces, use single quotes (apostrophes)
then to enclose such file names.<br>
Supported
wildcards are "*" (asterisk) for at least one&nbsp;alphanumeric
character including underscore and dot (a-z,A-Z,"_", ".") and "?"
(question mark) for exactly one occurrence of an alphanumeric character.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace; width: 930px;">java
-jar BDSUp2Sub.jar "reference\m?trix*.sup out\*.idx /lang:en
/res:ntsc"<br>
java -jar BDSUp2Sub.jar&nbsp;"'in path\m?trix*.sup' 'out
path\*.idx'
/lang:no /atr:40&nbsp;/res:1080 /forced"<br>
</div>
<br>
Note: the target file name must contain exactly one asterisk ("*") as
wildcard. It will be replaced with the according source file name
(stripped off its path and extension). If the source file name doesn't
contain wildcards, the asterisk in the target file name will be
replaced with the source filename stripped off its extension, but
including the path.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Application_Hints"></a>Application
Hints</h2>
<h3>Increasing the RAM size</h3>
Java application only get a maximum of 64MB of RAM per default. This
can lead to memory problems when loading SUPs with thousands of
warnings or if importing XML/PNG with very large images. The java
runtime supports command line switches to increase the RAM size though:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace; width: 620px;">java
<span style="font-weight: bold;">-Xmx256m</span>
-jar BDSUp2Sub.jar<br>
</div>
<br>
This will increase the maximum heap to 256MB of RAM which should be
enough in all cases. Since this is a parameter to the virtual machine,
it must be used before the "-jar" and it has no influence on
BDSup2Sub's command line switches.<br>
<h3>Disabling&nbsp;Direct3D support in case of problems</h3>
When
running in Windows, the Java runtime environment tries to make use of
Direct3D for hardware accelerated blitting and storing images in the
RAM of the video card. However due to implementation bugs in the JRE
and or the video card drivers, this can lead to problems with certain
combinations of hardware, video card drivers and JRE versions which
start with visual artefacts (redraw problems, flickering, displaced
graphics) and can end with system crashes. If this
happens, the use of Direct3D can be disabled by adding the command line
switch&nbsp;"-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false" when starting a Java
application.<br>
To
affect any Java application, it's usually a good idea to disable the
use of Direct3D globally by creating an environment variable called
"_JAVA_OPTIONS" with the value "-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false". This can be
done in the System control of the Windows control panel.<br>
Just in
case that you're using Eclipse, I'd like to mention that setting this
environment variable makes it impossible to start current versions of
Eclipse with the default launcher (Eclipse.exe). This is obviously a
weird bug in the launcher - then again, you can still start Eclipse
directly via the correct Jar.
<h3>Integration in the Windows Explorer</h3>
Unfortunately
it's impossible to change the Windows registry in Java without
sacrificing platform independence. So to register BDSup2Sub as default
application for SUP files, some manual work is needed.<br>
Cut out this text and save it with a plain text editor (e.g. NotePad)
as BDSup2Sub.reg (the extension ".reg" is important!).<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; height: 232px; width: 710px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239); width: 700px;">Windows
Registry Editor Version 5.00<br>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
Then
replace "E:\\dev\\java\\jre_6_0\\bin" with the path to your Java
runtime and &nbsp;"d:\\src\\java\\BDSup2Sub" with your installation
directory of BDSup2Sub. Remember to use double backlashes ("\\" instead
of "\")!!!<br>
Now save the file and double click it from the Explorer. Chose "yes" in
the following two dialogs.<br>
If you (and I) did everything right, BDSup2Sub should be used now to
open SUP files when you double click on them.<br>
You
can use the same approach of course to open VobSubs. Just replace "sup"
with "idx" and&nbsp;"SUP BD/HD-DVD caption stream" with "SUB/IDX
caption stream" or whatever you like as name.<br>
<h3>Desktop Integration (Icons)</h3>While BDSup2Sub has an application
icon, unfortunately, the default coffee cup of the Java Virtual Machine
is used if you created yourself a desktop icon to start
BDSup2Sub.&nbsp;This is because a
JAR is always opened with the installed JVM and so you get the icon of
the JVM, not the one of the application inside the JAR. Still it's
possible to change the icon manually (at least in windows, but I assume
this is the same in Linux and MacOS). For your convenience, not only
the PNG picture (icon_32.png) used by the application is included in
the JAR,
but also an ICO file for Windows and an ICNS file for MacOS X. I don't
know too much about Linux icons, but I's guess you should be able to
use the PNG. Anyway, to extract these icons, simply rename the JAR to
ZIP and extract the files.
<h3>Drag'n'Drop</h3>BDSup2Sub is able to open files via Drag'n'Drop. Just drag
a SUP, XML, IFO or IDX file on the application window and release the
mouse
button. As
BDSup2Sub is not able to open more than one subtitle stream at a time,
only
one&nbsp;file will be opened if you drag&amp;drop multiple
files.
Internally, always the first file in the passed
list is opened - this might however not be the file that is displayed
first in your selection. Anyway, this feature is meant for <span style="font-style: italic;">one file only</span>
anyway.<br>
Note:
as explained in the SUP/IFO section, Drag'n'Drop of a DVD-SUP will lead
to wrong detection as HD-DVD-SUP and the import will fail with error
messages. Drag'n'Drop of the IFO works though.<br>
<h3><a name="The_INI_file_persistence"></a>The
INI file (persistence)</h3>
BDSup2Sub
stores some settings in an INI file that is located in the same folder
as the JAR. You should usually not need to edit or delete the INI file.
Yet both is possible. If the INI file (or entries within it) is
missing, BDSup2Sub will use some default settings.<br>

<br>
As
you can see, some (yet not nearly all) program settings are stored in
the INI file. E.g. the default filter (in this case: "Mitchell") or the
verbatim output setting. Note that also "alphaCrop" and "mergePTSdiff"
are stored which can be (currently) only selected via the command line
(by using the parameters&nbsp;"/acrop" and "/tmerge"). This means
that
you don't need to set e.g. "/tmerge" every time you call BDSup2Sub.
This however also means that this setting is kept until you actively
change it again (or delete the INI file).<br>

<h2><a name="Change_History"></a>Change History</h2>
26.02.2009 1.0 -&gt; 1.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Added progress dialog for import</li>
<li>Added check for existing target files and write protection</li>
<li>Added detection of forced subtitles and the possibility to
export only forced subs</li>
<li>Removed some checks from RLE decoding to support some
non-standard frames which write to the next line without EOL</li>
<li>Fixed two small bugs in run length decoding (fixes reading
exports from SupRead)</li>
<li>Support for multi-packet pictures (well, exactly two
packets are supported for the moment)</li>
</ul>
<br>
02.03.2009 1.1 -&gt; 1.2<br>
<ul>
<li>Reworked SUP multipacket parsing to support unlimited
packets (kinda untested though for &gt; 2 packets).</li>
<li>Fixed bug in detection of primary color &amp; luminance
thresholds.</li>
<li>Added workaround to prevent crash when loading SUPs in
NTSC/PAL resolution.</li>
<li>Note that "upscaling" NTSC to PAL will not change the size
of the bitmap, only the offsets.</li>
<li>Also downsizing from PAL to NTSC might fail - I'll have to
reconsider this issue later.</li>
<li>Info was not updated when switching output format</li>
<li>Added fixed line feed after even and off RLE buffer since
VobSub sometimes skipped the last line</li>
</ul>
<br>
04.03.2009 1.2 -&gt; 1.3<br>
<ul>
<li>x/y ofs from start PCS is used instead of that from the
window definition (fixes most misaligned subtitles)</li>
<li>Time stamp inconsistencies are reported and fixed</li>
<li>Swapped checkboxes in export dialog to emphasize the
relation between the "Change frame rate" checkbox and the src/trg FPS</li>
<li>Added ini file to store frame size/position and load/save
paths. Probably more to follow.</li>
<li>Added upscaling (indeed the scaling algorithm already
supported it, only the factors were wrong)</li>
<li>Allowed all output formats for the moment. Dunno where this
will take us, but it's worth a try.</li>
<li>Added layout panel that shows the location of the subtitle</li>
<li>Worked a bit on the user interface (less rescaling of
components)</li>
<li>Removed warnings about empty palettes since this seems to
be pretty common.</li>
<li>All editable fields of export dialog read out again before
saving (indeed already done in 1.2)</li>
</ul>
<br>
06.03.2009 1.3 -&gt; 1.4<br>
<ul>
<li>Tinkered around with progress dialog to solve problems
under Vista. Can't test it though.</li>
<li>Added frame/sequence number checks/warnings</li>
<li>Added automatic elimination of double subtitle start frames.</li>
</ul>
<br>
06.03.2009 1.4 -&gt; 1.5<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed redraw bug and reduced memory needed for zoom modes.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused wrong start time in case of multiple
start packets or missing end packets.</li>
<li>Extended primary color detection to support "white,light
gray" in addition to "dark gray, light gray"</li>
<li>Added possibility to edit/save/load Vobsub palettes</li>
<li>Fixed blatant bug in export of forced subtitles which would
export the same frames over and over again</li>
<li>Set default alpha threshold to 80</li>
</ul>
08.03.2009 1.5 -&gt; 1.6<br>
<ul>
<li>Added support to write SUPs (kinda experimental though,
SupRip doesn't like'em).<br>
This included a major rework of the program's structure, so I hope I
didn't break anything.</li>
<li>Rewrote upscaling function (bilinear: slower, but much
better quality)</li>
<li>Fixed: half of the languages in the language selection box
were not displayed</li>
<li>While I was at it, I sorted the lower part of the list
alphabetically</li>
</ul>
10.03.2009 1.6 -&gt; 1.7<br>
<ul>
<li>BDSup2Sub now also works from the command line. See online
help for parameter description.</li>
<li>Some minor tweaks and correction here and there</li>
<li>Optimized RLE encoding for SUPs a little bit (two pixels of
the same color don't use RLE code)</li>
<li>Tried to add some better (?) fake time stamps to the
ODS/WDS/PDS/END packets.</li>
</ul>
13.03.2009 1.7 -&gt; 1.8<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in the palette
conversion introduced in r1.6 that could lead to artefacts on the left
side of the subpic (SUB/IDX export only)</li>
<li>Fixed wrong alpha threshold default in command line version
(SUB/IDX export only)</li>
<li>Introduced new resolution 1440x1080</li>
</ul>
11.03.2009 1.8 -&gt; 1.9<br>
<ul>
<li>Added support for reading HD-DVD SUPs (I own only one
HD-DVD, so chances are it won't work with many HD-DVDs)</li>
<li>The same selectable values appear in the ComboBox for
source and target FPS (still can be edited)</li>
<li>Reworked online help a little bit (also added working
Hyperlink to Doom9 thread and copy to clipboard functionality)</li>
<li>Renamed Mode/Format ComboBoxes to "Output Format" and
"Output Resolution"</li>
<li>Fixed wrong display&nbsp;of target image size
(introduced in r1.6)</li>
</ul>
15.03.2009 1.9 -&gt; 2.0<br>
<ul>
<li>SUP: palette is only exported up to the highest entry
actually used (previous versions always exported 256 entries)</li>
<li>Increased resolution of all internal time stamps to 90kHz
(was 1kHz)</li>
<li>During
export, start/end time (or start/delay) are synchronized to the target
frame rate (special handling for PAL, NTSC and 24P)</li>
<li>HD-DVD SUPs were refused from the command line: fixed.</li>
<li>New frame rate: 23.975Hz. equal handling of frame rates for
command line and export dialog (e.g. aliases)</li>
<li>Frame rate info is written into the PCS headers of created
BD-SUPs (and read for src fps detection)</li>
<li>Wildcard support for command line (read online help for
details)</li>
</ul>
17.03.2009 2.0 -&gt; 2.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: usage of wild card from the command line would cause
exception when source file name didn't contain a path</li>
<li>Fixed:
wrong VobSub packet size if only the control header was shifted to the
next packet, but the first packet was not completely filled.</li>
<li>Fixed: delay can be entered in milliseconds again. It's
adjusted to target frame rate automatically.</li>
<li>Added command line parameter "/dly" to define a delay</li>
<li>Added target frame rate auto detection for command line</li>
<li>Changed command line parameter "/fps" to allow setting of
only the target frame rate</li>
</ul>
18.03.2009 2.1 -&gt; 2.2<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: missing end times were not handled correctly.</li>
</ul>
22.03.2009 2.2 -&gt; 2.3<br>
<ul>
<li>Split export dialog into conversion dialog and export
dialog. Moved resolution setting to conversion dialog.</li>
<li>Completely reworked the time stamp check. It's done at
import now, not at export.<br>
Also the source time stamps are not altered any more to fix
missing/invalid times.</li>
<li>Added edit dialog to change offsets and timestamps</li>
<li>Added check/fix possibility for very short display
durations. Also new command line option "/tmin".</li>
<li>Automatic selection of language for SUB/IDX export if
filename contains (English) language name (e.g. "spanish")</li>
</ul>
25.03.2009 2.3 -&gt; 2.4<br>
<ul>
<li>Improved support for HD-DVD-SUPs (multiple DCSQ START
commands are supported, DCSQ is accumulated)</li>
<li>BD-SUP: subtitles without RLE buffer are ignored (led to
NullpointerException)</li>
<li>Fully transparent colors are always interpreted as
transparent black to not mess with scaling</li>
<li>Automatic language selection now only considers file name,
not the path name</li>
<li>Bilinear scaling is also used for scaling down</li>
<li>Better exception handling for general exceptions inside
threads</li>
<li>Edit dialog: duration can be entered as float value now
(just for consistency)</li>
<li>Accidentally changed time format from "hh:mm:ss:ms" to
"hh:mm:ss.ms" in IDX files. Fixed.</li>
</ul>
26.03.2009 2.4 -&gt; 2.5<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed:&nbsp;Cr and Cb color components were switched
when reading BD-SUPs (in since 1.0)</li>
<li>Fixed:&nbsp;inconsistent behavior of "export forced"
checkbox (probably introduced in 2.3)</li>
<li>Changed: console is cleared before loading a SUP to avoid
heap and performance problems (Swing text components are SLOW).</li>
<li>Changed: when copying console output to clipboard, the
clipboard is reset first to avoid OutOfMemoryException.</li>
<li>Changed: improved console output for BD-SUP reading to use
less lines in the console</li>
</ul>
27.03.2009 2.5 -&gt; 2.6<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Cr and Cb color components were switched when
writing BD-SUPs (introduced in 2.5)</li>
<li>Fixed: DSCQ is updated instead of accumulated for
HD-DVD-SUPs with multiple DSCQs</li>
<li>Changed: better detection for faded HD-DVD-SUPs</li>
<li>Changed: improved luminance threshold detection</li>
<li>Changed: added menu entry to swap Cr/Cb components</li>
</ul>
31.3.2009 2.6 -&gt; 2.7<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: added option to move all captions inside/outside
bounds (typically the cinemascope bars)</li>
<li>Changed: temporarily added workaround for (what I consider
a) bug in SupRip's RLE decoder</li>
<li>Changed: automatic language selection also from the CLI if
no language is given explicitly</li>
</ul>
02.04.2009 2.7 -&gt; 2.8<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: added drag'n'drop support</li>
<li>Changed: if one parameter (which is neither "/?" nor
"/help") is given, it's used as input file for the GUI</li>
<li>Fixed: HD-DVD-SUPs: next DSCQ is checked to avoid endless
loops.</li>
</ul>
05.04.2009 2.8 -&gt; 2.9<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed:
DTS (and internal PTS) time stamps are calculated now based on decoding
and composition pixel rates. Should hopefully improve muxing results of
exported SUP streams.</li>
<li>Changed: improved detection of start/end of caption -
should result in less warnings and better handling of problematic SUPs</li>
<li>Changed: better handling of BD-SUP palettes (multiple IDs,
palette update, alpha blending detection)</li>
<li>Changed:
much more flexible handling of CLI parameters. Options are allowed now
even if no target file name and/or no source file name is given. </li>
<li>Changed:
support for one asterisk in target file name even if there is no
wildcard in the source file name.&nbsp;The asterisk will be
replaced
with source path+filename without the extension.</li>
<li>Fixed: calling
BDSup2Sub with source file name as only parameter would fail if the
file name contained spaces. Now it should work with all file names as
long as they don't have multiple SUP/SUB/IDX extensions in them.</li>
<li>Fixed:
when changing the caption number in the edit and move dialogs, the
wrong caption number was displayed after returning to the the main view.</li>
</ul>
08.04.2009 2.9 -&gt; 3.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: reworked BD-SUP parser again to support multiple
objects per epoch and to split the epoch were it makes sense.<br>
Also equal captions can be merged now even if they're in separate
epochs. <br>
The rework also fixes RLE decoding errors caused by wrong handling of
multiple objects in 2.9.</li>
<li>Changed: added cropping support (crop the first n lines)</li>
<li>Changed: colorspace conversion according to BT.709 instead
of BT.601. Doesn't seem to make much of a difference though.</li>
<li>Fixed: the alpha fading detection for BD-SUPs could create
wrong colors in certain cases.</li>
</ul>
10.04.2009 3.0 -&gt; 3.1.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: depending on the resolution of an imported SUP,
either BT.601 (PAL/NTSC) or BT.709 (HD) is selected.</li>
<li>Changed: cropping is assumed to be symmetrical and now also
affects screen size in exported IDX or SUP.</li>
<li>Changed:
reworked default VobSub colors a little to provide better
anti-aliasing. Also white is used in combination with dark gray now.</li>
<li>Changed: minimum distance between two equal captions is now
fixed to 200ms and doesn't depend on minimum display time any more.</li>
<li>Changed: merged code and look of preview windows.</li>
<li>Changed:
all (?) edit boxes select smallest/biggest valid value if given value
is out of bounds instead of just ignoring invalid inputs.</li>
<li>Fixed: Merging captions failed in certain cases, which also
resulted in wrong end times</li>
<li>Fixed: BT.709 color space assumes Cr/Cb values to be inside
0..240 instead of 0..235</li>
<li>Fixed: exporting forced captions didn't work any more
(introduced in 2.9)</li>
<li>Fixed: value for min display time is also used if fix short
frames checkbox is unchecked.</li>
<li>Fixed: move dialog remembers screen ratio.</li>
</ul>
14.04.2009 3.1.0 -&gt; 3.2.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: palette is&nbsp;created by default when
scaling, mode can be selected (keep palette, new palette, dither)</li>
<li>Changed: reduced text output to a minimum. To get full
output, select "verbatim" mode.</li>
<li>Fixed: progress bar was never updated when importing
HD-SUPs, also cancel didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed: progress bar didn't work for very large files
(during load)</li>
</ul>
18.04.2009 3.2.0 -&gt; 3.3.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: added support for importing/exporting Sony BDN
XML/PNG format (used by Sonic Scenarist).<br>
Images are automatically cropped on import.</li>
<li>Changed: new command line option "/fps:keep" uses source
frame rate as target frame rate (for BD-SUP and XML)</li>
<li>Fixed: a little inaccuracy in (all) the scaling algorithms
led to slightly suboptimal results.<br>
The result of bilinear scaling is now very, very close to a reference
implementation.</li>
<li>Fixed: conversion dialog fps comboboxes showed "29.967"
instead of "29.97" for NTSC frame rates.</li>
<li>Fixed: crash when BD-SUP starts with invalid epoch.</li>
</ul>
18.04.2009 3.3.0 -&gt; 3.3.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: using XML as input didn't work from command line if
also a target was given.</li>
<li>Fixed: output resolution given via command line did not
influence selection in GUI.</li>
</ul>
18.04.2009 3.3.1 -&gt; 3.3.2<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: exported PNGs had changed palette order (so palette
entry 255 was not guaranteed to be transparent)</li>
</ul>
19.04.2009 3.3.2 -&gt; 3.4.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: added miscellaneous scaling filter modes (amongst
others: Bicubic, Lanczos3 and Mitchell)</li>
<li>Changed: improved quantizer to leave no multiple entries in
the palette</li>
<li>Changed: rewrote PNG importer to use palette of image if
that is possible</li>
<li>Fixed: added semaphore to synchronize GUI threads decoding
captions (fixes crashes when quickly jumping through captions)</li>
</ul>
21.04.2009 3.4.0 -&gt; 3.4.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed:
scaling images from/to 1 pixel width/height led to division by zero/out
of memory in scalers (happened with empty PNGs after cropping).<br>
Now scaling from/to this small sizes is inhibited. Also bitmaps in the
target are limited to a minimum of 2x2 pixels.</li>
<li>Fixed:&nbsp;lower
right coordinates displayed for target were wrong, also the window
offsets were displayed for the source instead of image offsets.</li>
</ul>
24.04.2009 3.4.1 -&gt; 3.4.2<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: crash when the very last epoch was discarded because
of missing ODS/PDS.</li>
</ul>
26.04.2009 3.4.2 -&gt; 3.4.3<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: when merging equal captions inside an epoch, the end
time was not always updated correctly.</li>
</ul>
<br>
03.05.2009 3.4.3 -&gt; 3.5.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: added support for importing VobSub (SUB/IDX).</li>
<li>Changed: forced flags are preserved when exporting to
VobSub.</li>
<li>Changed: added/changed comments in IDX files to workaround
bug in VobsubMuxer.</li>
<li>Changed: added command line switch (/tmerge) for setting
the maximum time for merging (BD-SUP) captions.</li>
<li>Changed: end time of one frame can be start time of the
next frame (no forced gap of 1 frame any more).</li>
<li>Fixed: assumed number of pixels in odd/even RLE buffers was
wrong for captions with odd line numbers.</li>
<li>Fixed: scaling of very small captions (like 3x3) could
still lead to crashes when using filters with large radius</li>
</ul>
03.05.2009 3.5.0 -&gt; 3.5.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: VobSub: delay was read from wrong position of
control buffer (-&gt; wrong end time).</li>
</ul>
06.05.2009 3.5.1 -&gt; 3.5.2<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: VobSub: wrong packet length is detected and fixed
(-&gt; now SUB/IDX files exported before 2.1 can be imported).</li>
<li>Changed: VobSub: improved luminance threshold detection
when importing SUB/IDX files.</li>
</ul>
07.05.2009 3.5.2 -&gt; 3.5.3<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed:&nbsp;when converting multiple files from the
command line, a fatal
error will not quit the program but just skip the file.</li>
<li>Fixed: BDN XML: 576i and 480i&nbsp; are used for PAL
and NTSC instead of 576p and 480p.</li>
</ul>
10.05.2009 3.5.3 -&gt; 3.5.4<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: VobSub: control header now can be split over two
packets. Seems to increase compatibility with SubtitleCreator.</li>
<li>Changed: some more info is printed in the non-verbatim
output mode (loading/writing files)</li>
<li>Fixed: BDN XML: due to the last fix in 3.5.3, 720p was not
recognized any more</li>
</ul>
12.05.2009 3.5.4 -&gt; 3.5.5<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed: VobSub: added padding packets (and stuffing bytes
via PTS length) to the exported stream.</li>
<li>Changed: VobSub: invalid offset to end sequence only throws
